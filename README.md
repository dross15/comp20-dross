The purpose of this Github respository is to store the code for the projects and labs I completed in COMP20 at Tufts University.

My favorite assignment was assignment 3- I really enjoyed getting to work with express and node. Further, I enjoyed developing a better understanding of how an API works, and how an API communicates with both the front-end and the database.

I think I have grown a lot since day 1 of class- I had some experience with front-end web development before taking this course but my exposure to the back-end was quite limited. My knowledge of the back-end expanded vastly, and I feel I now have a much stronger understanding of how a web application works as a whole. 

I think the two most important things I learned in this class were how to use Git, as evidenced by this respository, and also the use of first class functions and closures- which I think are essential to understand in order to become a web developer. Assignment 3 really challenged me to understand these ideas and put them into practice.

Now that I have finished the class I would like to dive deeper into frameworks, specifically React, and
begin teaching myself Swift to develop iOS apps.
